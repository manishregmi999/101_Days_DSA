//Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Notations
	1.	Infix Notation
		Operator is written between the operands.
		Example: A + B, (A + B) * C
     Requires parentheses to indicate order of operations when there are multiple operators.

	2.	Prefix Notation (Polish Notation)
	Definition: The operator is written before the operands.
	Example: + A B (equivalent to A + B), * + A B C (equivalent to (A + B) * C)
	No need for parentheses. order is determined by the position of operators. Useful for computers and stack-based calculations.

	3. Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation)
	Example: A B + ( A + B), A B + C * (A + B) * C)
	Does not require parentheses. Easy for computers to evaluate using stacks.
	The operator is written after the operands.
